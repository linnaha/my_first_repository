NotesÂ  
"The New York State calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class of 2005).  The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year).  Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma. "
,
"In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with cohorts of fewer than 10 students are suppressed."
"4 Year August outcomes are available since the 2004 cohort at the citywide level and since 2005 at the borough, district and school levels. 5 Year August outcomes are available since 2006. Cells are blank when data is not available."
"Charter schools are not included in NYSED's overall rate for NYC and, so, are not included here."
"For cohorts 2001 to 2006, District 79 was pulled out as a separate borough and district in those spreadsheets. Since 2007, D79 students are included in their geographic district and borough. School level results are shown for D1-D32 only.  "
"Prior to 2007, out of district placement students were not included in district results. "
"Beginning with the 2011 graduation cohort, the IEP Diploma was replaced by two credentials which are only available to students with IEPs. The Skills & Achievement Commencement Credential (SACC) is a certificate available only to students with severe cognitive disabilities who are eligible to take the NYSAA and have attended school for not less than 12 years, excluding Kindergarten. The Career Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS) Commencement Credential, which indicates that the student has the knowledge and skills necessary for entry level employment. It is available to students with IEPs who participate in standard assessment as either an endorsement to a diploma or a standalone exit certificate."
"As of January 1, 2014, the GED test is no longer offered in New York State. The GED has been replaced by the TASC (Test Assessing Secondary Completion) exam which will continue to lead students to a High School Equivalency (HSE) Diploma."
"In order to match NYSED's reporting, there are some instances where 'Total Regents' plus 'Local Dipomas' does not equal 'Total Grads' for 2001-2005."
"Because citywide, district and borough graduation cohorts include students in out of district placements, the total cohorts in these spreadsheets will not equal the total cohorts in the school-level spreadsheets."
